8# Student Management System
This is a simple console-based Student Management System built with Java.
It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using OOP principles like classes, interfaces, and in-memory storage.

## 📌 Project Overview
This Student Management System is designed to : 

• Add new students 
 
• Remove students by ID  
 
• View details of a single student   
 
• View all students
 
• Update existing student information   
 
• Exit the application

 ## 🔍 Code Overview
 Model/Student.java
Represents a single student with:

• id (int): unique identifier

• name (String): student’s name

• course (String): course enrolled

Includes:

• Constructor to initialize data

• Getters & setters

• toString() method to display student info in a readable format

## ✏️ Future Improvements (Ideas)
• Save student data to a file or database (persistence)

• Add validation (e.g., duplicate IDs)

• Build a GUI (Swing / JavaFX)

• Use Java Streams for filtering & searching

## 📖 Summary
This project demonstrates:

• Object-oriented programming in Java

• Working with interfaces and implementation classes

• Collections API (ArrayList)

• Simple user interaction via the console
